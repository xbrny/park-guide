              Kayak-ing in our lake is simple, you don't need to fear the water
              will splash to your face or your outfit. You can paddle the kayak
              calmly and enjoy the scenery. However, for comfortability please
              wear outfit that make it easy for you to paddle and enter the boat
            </p>
            <p class="mb-20">
              Please consider bringing extra outfit if you plan to paddle hard
              (good for your body)
            </p>
            <h3>Paddling technique</h3>
            <p class="mb-20">
              The first things we're going to look at is the proper sitting
              position in a kayak. One of the things that separates a very basic
              kayak from a higher quality kayak is the comfort of the seat. In
              fact, many kayaks have seats that are so comfortable, they make
              you want to lounge in them. Of course, there's nothing wrong with
              lounging in a kayak. But for the purposes of paddling, you need to
              sit up and have good posture. Sitting up straight with good
              posture will let you paddle harder, faster, and it'll help you
              avoid issues like back pain.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-20">
              Paddling with good posture means sitting upright and not leaning
              back. Your feet should be resting comfortably and securely against
              the foot pedals, and your legs should be comfortably flexed and a
              little splayed out. This leg position makes sitting upright easier
              and reduces the strain on your hamstrings and back. Quality kayaks
              also come with some type of adjustable back support, which can be
              loosened when you want to kick back and relax, and tightened when
              to encourage an upright sitting position.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-20">
              The second technique we're going to look at is how to properly use
              your paddle. The first thing to know about kayak paddles is that
              some are feathered and some are unfeathered. Unfeathered paddles
              have blades that are lined up with one another. Feathered paddles
              have blades that are opposite from each other to some degree. The
              offset of feathered paddles is designed to let the upper blades
              slice through the air and wind more easily when you take a forward
              stroke. The trade-off is that you need to twist the paddle when
              moving from one stroke to the next.
            </p>
            <h3>Safety</h3>
            <p class="mb-20">
              Kayak is not allowed during raining or strong wind, we will stop
              your kayaking if it's about to rain. However can still kayak
              afterward when the rain stops
