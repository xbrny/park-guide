            My name is Nur Fatini Binti Ramli. I am a student of Bachelor Degree
            Park and Amenity Management. I am currently in Semester 5.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-20">
            I was born on the 20th October 1995 on Friday at Hospital Besar Alor
            Setar, Kedah in a sweet and great family. I am from Kedah. I spend
            my first 11 year of life in Alor Setar before moving to Jitra which
            is a small city located in Kedah since on the 1st January 2007 with
            my family. So my current home now is at Jitra, Kedah.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-20">
            My family is a typical Malayan family. There are my parents (both 47
            years old), my two younger brother (one is 17 years old and another
            12 years old) and me. My mother is a business women. She is a nice
            and friendly person and likes to talk with other people. I also like
            to go and talk with other people. One more things she also loves
            cooking and baking for us when she have a free time. My father works
            as a business man and he has his own company. He own one of
            Contractor Company. My father is a caring person even though he is
            quite busy with his work, he never once ignored his responsibility
            as a father and husband to his child and of course to my mother. I
            have a good relationship to my both younger brother and my parents.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-20">
            I am a diploma holder in Plantation Industry and Management at UiTM
            Perlis. After I finished my diploma, I further studies in Bachelor
            Degree of Park and Amenity management which is my current course
            right now at UiTM Shah Alam. I like travelling and playing bowling.
            I always enjoyed reading and doing art. Growing up as a child and
            until now it has been mine and my parents dream for me to become an
            architect or a successful business lady.
